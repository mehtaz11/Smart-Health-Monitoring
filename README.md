# Smart-Health-Monitoring
The objective of this project is to design a Wearable Health Monitor system that tracks key  health parameters such as pulse rate, body temperature, SpO2, respiratory rate, and blood  pressure. The system will utilize LoRa communication to wirelessly transmit sensor data  from the wearable device to a remote LoRa-Dino receiver.
